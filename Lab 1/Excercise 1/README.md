# Exercise 1: Two-LED Blinking

## 1. Requirements

This exercise extends the basic blinking LED project by making both LEDs blink alternately.

* Connect **LED-RED** to pin **PA5** and **LED-YELLOW** to pin **PA6** of the STM32F103C6 microcontroller.
* Two LEDs should switch their states every 2 seconds.

## 2. Project Files

This folder contains the following project files:

* **Proteus_Circuit**: Contains the Proteus simulation file (`.pdsprj`).
* **Source_Code**: Contains the C code from STM32CubeIDE.
                    File `main.c`: The main source file with the blinking logic.

## 3. Schematic

The following schematic shows the circuit connections for this exercise.
